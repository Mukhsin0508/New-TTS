Below are explanations for both Python and Node.js environments.

Python:
Overview:
This algorithm converts text input into speech using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API. Users can choose from predefined voices and customize speech parameters such as pitch and speaking rate.

Prerequisites:
Google Cloud Service Account Key: Obtain a service account key JSON file from Google Cloud Console and set the path in the .env file.

bash
Copy code
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/key.json"
Python Environment: The algorithm is written in Python. Make sure you have Python installed.

Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install google-cloud-texttospeech
Usage:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the algorithm:

bash
Copy code
python your_algorithm.py
Follow on-screen instructions to choose voice options.

Customization:
You can customize the voices and speech parameters in the your_algorithm.py file. Refer to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API documentation for more details.
